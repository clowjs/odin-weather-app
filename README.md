# Weather App - The Odin Project

This is a simple weather app that uses the [weatherapi.com](www.weatherapi.com)'s API to get the current weather for a given city. It was built as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app).
